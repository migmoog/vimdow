# Contributing to Task Runner

## Contributing Code

We welcome contributions that improve the Task Runner plugin! Here's how to get started:

### Creating a Fork and Feature Branch

- Fork the repository on GitHub to your own account
- Clone your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/GodotTaskRunner.git`
- Create a feature branch with a descriptive name: `git checkout -b feature/add-python-support or git checkout -b fix/output-encoding-issue`
- Make your changes and commit them with clear, descriptive commit messages
- Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
- Open a Pull Request from your feature branch to our main repository

### What We're Looking For

Contributions are most likely to be accepted if they:

- Solve a clear problem or add meaningful functionality that benefits multiple users
- Maintain consistency with the existing codebase style and architecture (or improves on it!)
- Include documentation for new features or changed behavior. Update existing documentation if changing existing features or behavior.
- Are well-tested and don't break existing functionality
- Keep scope focused. Smaller, targeted PRs are easier to review than large rewrites
- Follow Godot conventions for plugin development and GDScript style

We may not accept contributions that significantly increase complexity without proportional benefit, add niche features that could be separate plugins, or require extensive maintenance burden.

## Reporting Issues
